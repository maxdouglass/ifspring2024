            <li>Max Douglass, Computer Science, Senior</li>
            <li>I'm a HCI minor and I'm working as a software developer after I graduate. I want to explore backend and front end development/design to see which one I like better.</li>
            <li>Yes, I've done some projects using HTML/CSS and a lot of experience with JS, specifically React. Over the summer I was apart of a program with the Skandalaris center where we could work on our own business ideas and we built our MVP using React.</li>
            <li>I hope to get more comfortable with CSS and get better about thinking how websites should be designed.</li>
            <li>You can scroll and click around. You have so many more options and I almost think this can make things much harder sometimes. There are almost too many options which can make it hard to know which direction to go in.</li>
            <li>I think <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> is an example of effective design. They make one product the key centerpiece for each frame of the screen. As you scroll down, you can essentially look at a different product but your focus is on one at a time. Their website is simple enough not to be distracting but visually interesting and engaging.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> is an example of a website that I think exemplifies communication. Their homepage, and the pages for specific topics make the content the centerpiece and have great readability.</li>
            <li>I think <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">AirBNB</a> is an example of great usability. Its very easy to know what the purpose of the website is as the listings are the highlight. Theres definetly a distinct feel and aesthetic but its not overwhelming.</li>
