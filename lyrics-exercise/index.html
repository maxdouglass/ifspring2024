                <p> Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? </p>
                <p> Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality </p>
                <p> Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see </p>
                <p> I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy </p>
                <p> Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low </p>
                <p> Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me </p>

                <p> Mama, just killed a man </p>
                <p> Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead </p>
                <p> Mama, life had just begun </p>
                <p> But now I've gone and thrown it all away </p>
                <p> Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry </p>
                <p> If I'm not back again this time tomorrow </p>
                <p> Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters </p>

                <p> Too late, my time has come </p>
                <p> Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time </p>
                <p> Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go </p>
                <p> Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth </p>
                <p> Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows) </p>
                <p> I don't wanna die </p>

                <p> Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me </p>
                <p> (Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico </p>
                <p> But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me </p>
                <p> He's just a poor boy from a poor family </p>
                <p> Spare him his life from this monstrosity </p>
                <p> Easy come, easy go, will you let me go? </p>
                <p> Bismillah! No, we will not let you go </p>
