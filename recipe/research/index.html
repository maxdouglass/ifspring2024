                        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>General Preparation:</strong>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Heat oven to 375°F. Grease two 8 or 9-inch round baking pans. I like to cut a round piece of wax or parchment paper for the bottom of the pan also, to make sure the cake comes out easily.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>For the Cake:</strong>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Stir together sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
                                    <li>In a separate bowl, combine the eggs, buttermilk, oil, and vanilla and mix well.</li>
                                    <li>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix to combine.</li>
                                    <li>Stir in boiling water (batter will be very thin).</li>
                                    <li>Pour batter into prepared pans.</li>
                                    <li>Bake for 25 - 35 minutes (depending on your cake pan size. The 9'' pan takes less time to bake) or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with few crumbs.</li>
                                    <li>Cool 5 minutes in the pan and then invert onto wire racks to cool completely.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>For the German Chocolate Coconut Frosting:</strong>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>In a medium saucepan add brown sugar, granulated sugar, butter, egg yolks, and evaporated milk. Stir to combine and bring the mixture to a low boil over medium heat.</li>
                                    <li>Stir constantly for several minutes until the mixture begins to thicken.</li>
                                    <li>Remove from heat and stir in vanilla, nuts, and coconut. Allow to cool completely before layering it on the cake.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>For the Chocolate Buttercream Frosting:</strong>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Melt butter. Stir in cocoa powder.</li>
                                    <li>Alternately add powdered sugar and milk, beating to spreading consistency.</li>
                                    <li>Add a small amount of additional milk, if needed, to thin the frosting, or a little extra powder, until you reach your desired consistency. Stir in vanilla.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Cake Assembly:</strong>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Place one of the cake rounds on your serving stand or plate.</li>
                                    <li>Smooth a thin layer of chocolate frosting over the cake layer, and then spoon half of the coconut frosting on top, spreading it into a smooth layer. Leave about ½ inch between the filling and edge of the cake.</li>
                                    <li>Stack the second cake round on top. Smooth chocolate frosting over the entire cake.</li>
                                    <li>Spoon remaining coconut frosting on top of the cake.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>

                <h3>Recipe website examples</h3>
                <div>
                    <h4>Example 1: <a href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/strawberry-frosted-layer-cake/3d687c23-1c56-49d4-85ed-bd190441a284">bettycrocker.com</a></h4>
                    <p>I like this recipe page because it is very visual. You don't have to scroll far to see pictures of what you are making, which is always a plus when you have great pictures. I also like the way the ingredients and instructions are easily visible, near the top and centered.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Example 2: <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/tuscan-chicken-recipe-23624913">thekitchn.com</a></h4>
                    <p>This recipe page starts out with a large and high quality image of the dish, which I think is great for enticing the reader. This recipe also starts off with a longer description of the dish and the instructions that is very detailed, and then has step by step ingredients and instructions further down the page. I think this approach works well for readers who are interested in food and are experienced chefs, but may not be as useful for new chefs or people who are in a hurry.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Example 3: <a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/homemade-banana-bread/">budgetbytes.com</a></h4>
                    <p>I like this recipe page but not as much as the previous examples. I think that it has a strong aesthetic, and feels more like a blog than just instructions for a recipe. This can be good if the reader is interested in cooking, banana bread, or the chef who is writing the recipe. However, the actual step by step instructions and ingredients are quite far down the page which can make it hard for someone just looking to cook the banana bread.</p>

                <h3>Nonrecipe website examples</h3>
                <div>
                    <h4>Example 1: <a href="https://www.apple.com/">apple.com</a></h4>
                    <p>Apple may seem like an example of a website that is very different from a recipe webpage, however, I think there are aspects of Apples website that would work well in a recipe page. The minimilism, focus on less content at a time, and visual aspects of Apples site could all lend themselves well to a recpie webpage. I think utilizing great images of the food is one of the most important aspects of a recipe page, as someone is much more likely to actually use a recipe where the food is advertised in an appealing way and looks appetizing.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Example 2: <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Cook">wikihow.com</a></h4>
                    <p>Wikihow is a great example of how to make a website that clearly shows a process. Their use of pictures, and clear hierarchy of steps makes the instructions easy to follow. I especially like the use of photos throughout the steps and think that is especially helpful when recipes do that.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Example 3: <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Easy-Wire-and-Tape-Pendants/">instructables.com</a></h4>
                    <p>This site shows off instructions in a clear way that could be applied to recipes. The use of images along the top is something I've mentioned in earlier examples and is also done here. They also use imagery throughout, and I like how there are no ads or links on the sides so the user can be completely focused on the project being outlined in the instructions.</p>
